# (along with the junit testing framework), and an executable .jar file.
#
# To RUN THE JAR FILE, change to the dist directory and run:

        java -jar Baristamatic.jar

# To COMPILE THE SOURCES directly, 
# run from the Baristamatic directory (top level):

        javac -cp ./lib/junit-4.12.jar -d ./bin src/*.java

# To RUN THE SOURCES directly, 
# run from the Baristamatic directory (top level):

        java -cp ./bin:./lib/junit-4.12.jar com.palmer.sample.Baristamatic

# To RUN THE TEST CASES directly, 
# run from the Baristamatic directory (top level):

        java -cp ./bin:./lib/junit-4.12.jar:./lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar com.palmer.sample.BaristaTestRunner

# NOTE: to create Baristamatic.jar from the bin directoy:
#
        jar -cfe Baristamatic.jar com/palmer/sample/Baristamatic com/palmer/sample/*.class
